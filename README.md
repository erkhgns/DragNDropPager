# DragNDropPager
Drag button elements between fragments & cutomize it. This buttons are aligned in a grid layout pattern, but it's parent layout is relative layout rather than gridlayout.

## Getting Started
After installing the library to your gradle files we'll start first on creating a drag and drop using a single page.

### Single DNDPager

The single DNDPager class is the core of the library, this is responsible for creating views & managing them. To create a single page DNDPager, create a relative layout with an id of rl_grid1.
```
<RelativeLayout
            android:id="@+id/rl_grid1"
            android:layout_width="match_parent"
            android:layout_weight="1"
            android:layout_height="0dp">
</RelativeLayout>
```
Then in your class e.g MainActivity.java, initilize your layout. 
```
RelativeLayout rl_grid1 = findViewById(R.id.rl_grid1);
```
Create a list of DNDItems. It is recommended to used the ```final``` keyword as it will be used in callbacks
```
final List<DNDItem> rl_item_list = new ArrayList<>();
rl_item_list.add(new DNDItem("POWER",null,Color.parseColor("#e67e22"),"1"));
rl_item_list.add(new DNDItem("UP",null,Color.parseColor("#8e44ad"),"2"));
rl_item_list.add(new DNDItem("DOWN",null,Color.parseColor("#e74c3c"),"3"));
```

The **DNDItem** class has two types of constructors. The first constructor only accepts the necessary variables, while the x & y coordinates will be automatically generated and the size are always set to 1.
> background_color is used only if the background_image is null.
```
DNDItem(String text, Drawable background_image, int background_color, String tag)
``` 
The seconds constructor is the most complex. As it specifies every details from the item. The x & y coordinates can still be automatically generated by passing values of -1. The page_num parameter specifies which page it is previewed on, commonly used for ViewPagers. 
```
DNDItem(String text,int cell_height_ratio, int cell_width_ratio, int x, int y,  Drawable background_image, int background_color, int page_num, String tag)
```
> Items that are out of bounds (cell ratio that is greater than layout's row & col num) will never be shown.
> To check if an item is added to the layout or not, call DNDItem.is_added from the list.

Create a class DNDPager, then specify the number of columns & rows from that page & group id.
```
//DNDPager(RelativeLayout layout, final int row_num, final int col_num, String group_id,Context context);
DNDPager(rl_grid1,4,2,"power_id",getApplicationContext())
```
> you can use group_id to pass draggable views between layouts with the same group id.

To apply the DNDItem list call the DNDPager.render(IDNDPager.ActionEvent post_action) method.
```

```
